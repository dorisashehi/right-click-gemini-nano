- [ ] No CSS errors in console

### 5. Test Content Script

  - "✅ Extension installed successfully"

### 7. Test TypeScript Compilation

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Milestone 2 is complete when:**

- ✅ Extension builds without errors
- ✅ React popup displays with modern UI
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling works correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
- ✅ Content script loads on web pages
- ✅ Background script runs properly
- ✅ All console logs appear as expected

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**If build fails:**

1. Check that all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Verify TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`
3. Check Vite configuration in `vite.config.ts`

**If popup doesn't open:**

1. Make sure you're loading the `dist` folder, not the root folder
2. Check that `popup.html` exists in the `dist` folder
3. Verify manifest.json has `"default_popup": "popup.html"`

**If styling doesn't work:**

1. Check that Tailwind CSS is properly configured
2. Verify `postcss.config.js` exists
3. Check that CSS is being imported in `popup.tsx`

**If content script doesn't load:**

1. Check that `content.js` exists in `dist` folder
2. Verify manifest.json has content_scripts configuration
3. Try refreshing the webpage
